What kinds of creative and critical engagement with technology practices can enable meaningful change when we do it with others?

Our theme focuses on how we **Do It With Others (DIWO)** as opposed to just ourselves as we build new network infrastructures and draws on the distributed campaign for emancipatory, networked art practices, instigated by UK-based Furtherfield (2006) as a response to the Do It Yourself (DIY) movement. We have seen a growing number of peer-to-peer, inclusive, and privacy-respecting projects mobilizing in favour of resilient, accessible, equitable communications over the internet in 2017. And yet many open questions remain. In the face of threats to the open internet, which tools and tactics will help us recognize the opportunities and challenges of this moment?

## Program Highlights

We have a schedule full of awesome sessions, you can expect:

- Talks on distributed data stewardship, migrating to peer-to-peer implementations, and tactics used by existing protocols with a view to changing the internet
- Discussions about transitioning to decentralized projects and imagining what alternatives we want
- Hands-on workshops to strategize outreach and organizing tactics at the local level

## Registration

We have three admission types: Organization Supporter, Supporter, and Reduced Cost. The true cost for us to host this event is $57 per person. Your support at or above that price allows us to offer reduced cost admissions and use sponsorship money elsewhere. If it is difficult to attend even at a reduced cost, contact us at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}). We are able to support a limited number of scholarships and are also looking for volunteers interested in helping at the event in return for complimentary admission.

| Admission Level | Price | Details |
|:----------------|:------|:--------|
| Organization Supporter | $100 + fees | Consider registering as organization supporter if your org is paying or your registration can be reimbursed. This allows us to offer reduced cost admissions and scholarships. |
| Supporter | $50 + fees | Consider registering as a supporter to allow us to put sponsorship money toward our other operating costs. |
| Reduced Cost | $20 + fees | If you are unwaged, a student, or otherwise in need of a reduced cost registration. |

We also have [swag](/swag/) you can purchase at registration (also during the conference). Pickup will be available both days of the conference.
