What kinds of creative and critical engagement with technology practices can enable meaningful change when we do it with others?

Our theme focuses on how we **Do It With Others (DIWO)** as we build new network infrastructures and draws on the distributed campaign for emancipatory, networked art practices, instigated by UK-based Furtherfield (2006) as a response to the Do It Yourself (DIY) movement. We have seen a growing number of peer-to-peer, inclusive, and privacy-respecting projects mobilizing in favour of resilient, accessible, equitable communications over the internet in 2017. And yet many open questions remain. In the face of threats to the open internet, which tools and tactics will help us recognize the opportunities and challenges of this moment?

## Program Highlights

We have a full schedule of sessions, you can expect:

- Talks on how to change the internet, whether through new forms of distributed data stewardship, migrating to peer-to-peer implementations, or by studying tactics used by existing protocols
- Discussions about transitioning to decentralized projects and imagining what alternatives we want
- Hands-on workshops to strategize outreach and organizing tactics at the local level
