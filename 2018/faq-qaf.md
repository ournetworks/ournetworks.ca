We have a slowly-growing list of Frequently asked questions/Questions to ask frequently, if you don't see yours below, send us an email

### Are the venues accessible?

We are committed to addressing barriers to access. So far we've confirmed a Conference and Sprint space that are entered by ramp and elevator, with accessible washrooms.

### What is the deal with project sprints?

Project sprints are a great way to work together to learn and create Do It With Others (DIWO)-style. The [Sprints](/2018/sprints/) page has a list of projects and details for proposing your own

### I am traveling from out of town, how can I stay in Toronto affordably? (a.k.a. What are Community Billets?)

We do not have a discount rate with a hotel, however we have arranged for a limited number of spots for those looking for a place to stay, check out the [community billets list](#) to coordinate!

### What is the best way to get around Toronto?

Toronto in July is easily navigable by bike ([Bike Share Toronto](https://bikesharetoronto.com/)), public transportation ([TTC](http://www.ttc.ca/)), and to many places on foot.

### Who are the organizers?

We are a [group](https://github.com/ournetworks/2018#organizers) with many members also involved in [Toronto Mesh](https://tomesh.net/) who have been planning events around network literacy, community networks, and building mesh networks  in the city for the past two years.

### I want to make this even even better, how can I help?

Awesome! First, consider [tabling at our Yami-ichi](/2018/kickoff-yami-ichi/) or [pitching a project for our Sprints](/2018/sprints/). If those don't appeal we'd love to have weekend volunteers, email us at orga@ournetworks.ca!
