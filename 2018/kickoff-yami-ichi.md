S*%t happens. Didn't used to. Like when some small off-handed private comment
turns into an SNS flame war. Or worrying about not getting enough “Likes”. The
Youtube videos you can't watch anymore because somebody complained. Or the apps
you can't play because they were rejected by Apple. Once upon a time, the
Internet was supposed to be a place for "liberty". Nowadays it's so uptight.

So let's turn off, log-out, and drop in, on the real world. The Internet
Yami-Ichi is a flea market for “browsing” face-to-face.

Take your own Internet liberties* here, with us.

* But no dangerous or illegal goods, please! This black market wants to remain
free and useful!
```

Calling all vendors of internet-ish things! Come gather and exchange goods from the backstreets of the Internet Friday July 13, 2018 afternoon into evening.
