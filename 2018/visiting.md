We have a slowly-growing list of questions for those visiting the event, if you don't see yours answered below, send us an email at {{ site.email }}.

### Are the venues accessible?

We are committed to reducing barriers to access throughout the event. All spaces--for kickoff, conference, and sprints--have elevator access and accessible washrooms.

### I am traveling from out of town, how can I stay in Toronto affordably? (a.k.a. What are Community Billets?)

We do not have a discount rate with a hotel, however we have arranged for a limited number of spots for those looking for a place to stay, check out the [community billets list](#) to coordinate!

### What is the best way to get around Toronto?

Toronto in July is easily navigable by bike ([Bike Share Toronto](https://bikesharetoronto.com/)), public transportation ([TTC](http://www.ttc.ca/)), and to many places on foot.

### I want to make this even even better, how can I help?

Awesome! First, consider [tabling at our Yami-ichi](/yami-ichi/) or [pitching a project for our Sprints](/2018/sprints/). If those don't appeal we'd love to have weekend volunteers, email us at {{ site.email }}!
