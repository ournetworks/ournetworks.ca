Monday–Wednesday • 16–18

Modelled after [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2018/community/sprints/), we are providing space for project sprints following the conference. Sprints provide an opportunity for people interested in a project to come together to learn and create in a truely Do It With Others (DIWO) environment. The goal is to make friends and build lasting relationships through working together to share knowledge, build features, hack on prototypes, and polish resources.

We'll take care of providing space from 10am - 9:30pm Monday through Wednesday with hi-speed internet, power bars, post-its, and markers.

## Join a Sprint

Add your name to the list and make sure to watch the sprint pitches on Sunday at the conference, the project lead will be there providing an overview.

| Project Name | Project Lead | Description and Goals | Attending |
|:-------------|:-------------|:----------------------|:----------|
|              |              |                       |           |


## Propose a Sprint

Anyone can propose a Sprint in the lead up to and at the conference. If a new idea comes up during Our Networks and you feel a Sprint may be the right format to test / kickstart the project, we encourage people pitch a Sprint.

Pitching a Sprint requires a short description about the idea along with the following information:

- Project name with a website or link if one exists
- Sprint lead with contact email
- Two-three sentence project description and sprint goals

For example:

```
Toronto Mesh
@benhylau, benhylau@example.com
Toronto Mesh is a local mesh network initiative in Toronto. The sprint will
focus on improving our setup documentation for new nodes including all services
on existing software. From 10am to 1pm on July 16 there will be introductory
presentations and anyone can pitch a presentation throughout the sprint.
```

<br/>

After that, you'll need to attend the sprint pitches on Sunday afternoon to give us a 5 minute overview of the project.
