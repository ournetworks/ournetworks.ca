Our Networks is a conference about the past, present, and future of building our own network infrastructures. Now in its second year, the event brings together enthusiasts, hardware and software hackers, researchers, organizers and more to collectively explore creative and critical engagements with the Internet and alternative infrastructures.

Our Networks has a <a href="/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>, for any conduct reports or concerns please email <a href="mailto:coc@ournetworks.ca">coc@ournetworks.ca</a>.


### I want to make this even even better, how can I help?

You should consider [tabling at our Yami-ichi](/yami-ichi/) or [pitching a project for our Sprints](/2018/sprints/). We are [planning this event openly](https://github.com/ournetworks/2018) so you can also check tasks we are working on. If those activities don't appeal to you, we will need volunteers to help the event run smoothly--reach out to us at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> to be added to the volunteer list.
