    description: "Wireless Toronto is a community wireless network run by volunteers, dedicated to the growth of no-cost wireless Internet access in Toronto's public and publicly accessible spaces. Since the group's founding in May 2005, volunteers set up almost 40 hotspots across the GTA, including some of the city's largest: St. Lawrence Market, Yonge-Dundas Square, and the York Quay Centre at Harbourfront.
      At its peak, the network served over 1000 connections per day.
      For a variety of reasons, the Wireless Toronto network has shrunk over time, and today only a handful of nodes remain active. This presentation will outline the group's history, successes and learnings."

    description: "In this session, I will present Mesh Orange, a Debian-based router that runs on various single-board computers (SBCs), which together form an autonomous encrypted mesh network. The operating system supports various WiFi hardware and features a configuration system that allows local mesh communities to specify custom hardware settings. After walking through the steps to form a physical mesh network with Mesh Orange, we will run peer-to-peer applications on these SBCs to show a possible internet where networked applications are serviced by distributed protocols communicating over physical nodes arranged in a mesh topology."

      Blockchain is everywhere these days - from finance and law, to kitten-collecting, dating-apps, and ice tea companies. This workshop will explore what this technology offers, how it works, and what it can and cannot do in a friendly, playful setting. We will introduce the basics of how blockchains work in a short presentation, and then expand on them with a facilitated session of Scrabits, a modified version of scrabble based on the bitcoin blockchain. Concepts explored will be - what is a ledger, what are the unique challenges of maintaining a decentralized way, and how bitcoin solves these problems."

The urban development models of the past are beginning to fall short in creating cities that support the reality of our current existence. Networks aren't just nodes and links designated by code—they are accessed and used by real people over physical infrastructure that exists in physical space. How does the network interface with the city, and with the public? What are the individual and collective experiences and interactions that are enabled by these networks in practice?"

    linkDisplay: "Ouinet"
    description: "Currently, most websites and apps depend on centralized servers despite the limitations of this structure. Migration towards P2P architectures may be encouraged by solutions which support the current centralized paradigm while taking advantage of P2P architectures, making apps more resilient to interference and letting users' devices empower the underlying P2P network. For that reason we created Ouinet, a technology where an entire cooperative network helps serve HTTP requests using P2P routing and distributed cached responses, mitigating the single point of failure due to client apps not being able to connect to the server.
      We will discuss the philosophy and design behind Ouinet, how we integrated various P2P technologies such as IPFS and I2P to achieve its objectives, and demonstrate how an alpha implementation can be integrated in Android apps to defy network interference while saving on server bandwidth and remote resources, as we shall also see during the sprints days."

    description: "As the internet evolves and changes, what material of the internet's past will continue to be available? What is being actively preserved for the future, and who is doing this work? In this session I'll discuss my doctoral research project that explores these questions through two cases studies of web archiving by national libraries and academic research libraries which are part of the International Internet Preservation Consortium. These cases are representative of the many web archiving initiatives and practices tied to existing centralized structures - supported by government and academic institutions, as well as methods of crawling tied to infrastructures like country code top-level domains. These institutional efforts can be seen to contrast with distributed communities like Archiveteam as well as activist and community web archives. And increasingly, individual people can also create and curate their own collections with tools like webrecorder.io that are geared towards users who are not coders."

Since July 2017, founding partners EDGI, qri.io, and Protocol Labs, have been prototyping open source and decentralized archiving of web pages and data sets using IPFS. Initiatives also include public engagement through in-person events and topical roundtable conversations through online webinars.
      This talk will speak to the tensions and successes in our early prototypes and address the values motivating our work."

    description: "The philosophers have only interpreted the internet, the point is to change it.
      IP, BGP, DNS, HTTP, and many more protocols set the boundaries of what we do on the internet. Their specifications and implementations have enabled many great advances, but some of these advances have revealed structures and mechanisms that are objectively counter to their users' needs and wants.
      Our communities are radical in many ways, and some of our shared principles are
      accessibility, ubiquity, sustainability, resilience, and impact.
      We'll look at effective tactics used by protocols, old and new, to achieve these principles."

    description: "The digital divide in Mexico is not just a matter of connectivity. The deployment of physical infrastructure must be coupled with a cultural, linguistic and community perspective, able to provide internet access as a way to exercise a wide range of rights. Article 19 Mexico and Central America office is doing field work in the state of Chiapas to analyze, from a broad perspective, the impact of connectivity policies and the lack to internet access on indigenous communities and the raising of local initiatives to build community networks. The project is linked to the work of the organization to promote proactive transparency that allows people, particularly women, to use access to information mechanisms to defend other rights.
      Sharing this experience is an opportunity, firstly to present preliminary results of the field work but also to generate significant links with other initiatives looking to consolidate long term projects in which communities play an active role to promote access to Internet, develop strategies for digital literacy and appropriate the use ICTs."

    description: "In the world we live in, there is a near-universal social norm that says greater connectivity, a more global web, and more pervasive digital networks are an inherent good. We see this sentiment reflected everywhere, from the obvious manifestations in IoT devices, cellphones, and Facebook, to more implicit forms, such as in the fights for greater digital security, more censorship-resistant communication, or more distributed control of these networks. As communities involved in shaping the future of these networks, and whose futures will in turn be shaped by them, it seems worth asking: Is a more networked world really always what we want?
      Rather than try to answer this question directly, we will instead provide a short introduction to the topic, then help guide an open discussion, focusing on what it means in practice for us involved in the development of these networks."

    description: "The interdisciplinary creative practices of fandom — whether it be fanfiction, fanart, or cosplay — challenge our previously held notions of authorship, but also uphold the open internet's emancipatory values. Networked-based online creations thrive within particular fandoms, and its community-based model has enabled authors to create works that bring in feminist as well as queer and critical race studies approaches, especially through genres like slash. So how are these fan methodologies reshaping the practices of artists and curators? This conversation will map out the ways in which three 'fans' AKA contemporary artists/curators are bringing these so-called fan perspectives into their work, and explore how fandom cultivates alternative means of capacity-building and storytelling."

    description: "Although we access internet from many locations acoss our communications, our expectations for connectivity and availability of content are somewhat more static. In these moments our experience of the networked connectivity is embedded in not only files and bandwidth, but also mixes the activities of passerby and environmental features. Our ways of accessing information (i.e. files, content, etc) could be significantly diversified in networks without ubiquitous (centrally provided) broadband, where access might be linked to the physical environment or physical storage, such as in dead drops or Cuba's budding public wifi access or their 'sneakernet' style paquete semanal.
      What might happen when network connectivity works differently in shared spaces of transit, leisure and work? What are the possible benefits of challenging the expectation of ubiquitous broadband and the cadence of constant connectivity- the what ethical issues might arise? Can we create different sorts of networks that fit the constraints and character of different spaces and human activities around them?"

      This talk begins from a seemingly simple cultural historical premise: that the Net Art/Anti-Globalism movement theories of data-bodies, new forms of civil disobedience, and the performative matrix of artist networks between virtual and real spaces were formed under pre-digital conditions and artistic practices based in the intermedia movement. More importantly, I argue that pre-digital practices of the artist communications infrastructure as both network and counterinstitution--derived from media revolutions of the underground press, conceptual and process art practices of social sculpture, and working class progressivist artist workers movements of the 20th century--allowed for counterhegemonic deterritorializations and reterritorializations of emergent media networks and resources. These intermedia cultural movements prioritized hybrid ontologies and adapted tactically from the pre-digital to digital cusp through media ecologies of electronic globalization characterizing neoliberal mobility and modularity."

    description: "The ongoing discussion about decentralisation has been dominated by the talk of blockchains lately. While they do work in certain fields, in social networks the bottleneck and restrictions imposed by the distributed consensus render it challenging to build a social network on a blockchain that does not suffer from speed issues.
      This talk explores a different way of building networks that does not depend on distributed consensus. By making a small number of tradeoffs, it is possible to build a network that can scale to 10^3x the speed in inserting new data and distributing it. Aether is one such attempt, and both it and the underlying protocol is open source. This talk will focus on how it ended up coming to be, why, and how it works, and what you can build with the underlying protocol."

    description: |
      Technology has so fundamentally changed our society that any strategy for social change must be altered to address its power over us. But it also gives us the potential to develop and realize the kind of society we all want and to do that within our lifetimes. Information technology is the most powerful tool for change we have.
      Since 2017, 25 local convergences have brought together over 1,500 activists from the U.S. to talk about the intersection between technology and revolution. The results of this two-year project can be viewed in the program that emerged from those sessions summarized in the video linked below.
      techandrev.org
      We want to continue that process in a Tech and Rev session at this conference with our convergence here adding to and editing the program as it now stands.
      Panel speakers are:
      > Alfredo Lopez, May First Movement Technology
      > Ellie Ade Kur, Maggie's
      > Lorraine Chuen, IntersectTO
      > Victoria Barnett, Design Justice Network

      If the only thing you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail, right? Then why wonder how came our engineers are mostly building centralized client-server data silos, if in the core of their curriculums usually lies a mental model of computing from 70s, with a singular mainframe being programmed and used from multiple "dumb" terminals. And then history replicates itself, and modern-day Facebook uses our multi-GHz, multi-GB, multi-core devices as dumb terminals of sorts. Let's see what tools and approaches are there at your command, if you decide to build something else, something more decentralized, more resilient, frequently more performant and bringing agency back to end users.

      Workers' rights are losing respect, the power of technology is not fully understood – gone are the eras of strength of 1940s US labor unions. A financial environment cushioned by unregulated laws created an orange-coloured disease, Amazon, that systemically targets poor people, Black communities and communities of color. It spreads precarity as a contagion, strengthens digital redlining, and produces predatory surveillance: Amazon, the company, has changed the world. Also, it has changed the word. Amazon will come to solely signify the company and not the Brazilian rainforest. I will speak on the 'Amazonification' of the world and its role in spreading neoliberal ecoterrorism by remapping environmental scarcity as precarity onto vulnerable populations. I will connect this to the company's predatory system of surveillance through its in-house facial recognition software and serving as the tech-backbone of ICE. Through the innocuous frame of consumption, this talk and screening decrypts the 'success' behind corporate rendering of workers' labor as invisible and through its AI algorithms extending the carceral state.

      Made in Iran is the outcome of several interviews with 12 Iranian individuals, living in the United States, whose lives  are  affected  by  the  travel  ban.  Throughout  this  conversation  they  portrayed  how,  as  the  result of recent feuds between the two countries, their identities are often assumed by others to only comprise  their  nationality.  In  this  project  I  tried  to  portray  their  complexity,  depth  and  presence  by  interviewing  them  and  asking  them  to  share  in  a  series  of  words  and  images  that  more  accurately  reflects their identity.

      The current state of the web is giant silos of data from giant corporations that don't care about your privacy. Creating something on your own terms means hosting hardware, learning "back end" programming, and all sorts of barriers to entry. Luckily, decentralized and P2P technology has gotten really popular. The distributed web is actually a lot easier to work with that you might expect, and doesn't require any "back end" experience. Dat is a P2P protocol that makes it easy to share and update files over a Peer To Peer network. What's more, people can create websites with it directly from a web browser. This workshop will walk people through publishing their first P2P website using Dat and some retro-feeling HTML. Bring your laptop or phone and expect garish colors, obnoxious GIFs, and the <marquee> element.

VERANTWORTUNG 3000 (2016), HOFFNUNG 3000 (2017) and now p2panda are platforms and protocols to setup groups, festivals, gatherings, events or spaces in a decentralised, self-organised manner which allow us to raise questions on how we organise ourselves in our social, artistic & theoretical communities. We will look into implementations / realisations of decentralised festivals and talk about how they influenced our way of discussing and producing art and technology. Finally we will discuss p2panda, an idea of a p2p protocol for organising resources, places and events based on a new data structure named »bamboo«, which is inspired by the SSB protocol.

      'Currency' is an electronic game and custom game console constructed from an obsolete 1917 Burroughs adding machine and a microcontroller. The console monitors the exchange rate of bitcoins to US dollars and uses this data to generate a game level that prints out on a roll of receipt paper. Using the adding machine's grid of numeric buttons, players attempt to pull two columns of printed ASCII symbols together while being either aided or impeded by the current Bitcoin value.

      As resistance to state control continues to grow, states are reacting by tightening the restrictions on the flow of information surrounding these uprisings and protests. One of the main tools at their disposal is to leverage their control over centralized Internet infrastructure to block access to news sites, social media, and content that threaten their authority. Tor Project is working on a way to circumvent these restrictions on information. This talk will describe a way we can collectively fight back by hosting P2P proxies in our browsers to share our agency with others. Snowflake is a new censorship circumvention tool that relies on the participation of many to further widen the cracks in state-imposed Internet firewalls.

    description: >
      This paper proposes information technology (IT) infrastructure is formulating a universal language. It dips into historic efforts to create a universal language via avant garde filmmaking and Gottfried Leibniz's characteristica universalis. It then explains how international standardization organizations are developing the globally unified infrastructural language through their regulations. The paper weighs the benefits and consequences of a universal language by looking into who IT infrastructure serves and who is excluded. As Marshall McLuhan inferred in his 1964 essay, 'The Medium is the Message,' technology becomes inseparable from the messages it transmits, adding another layer of meaning to what is communicated; language, in turn, starts to be shaped around the tools that facilitate it. Thus, IT infrastructure is not just a tool to communicate, but is part of language itself.

      Channel Channel is a project that involves around the basic usage, access and further social dynamics of VPN, which stands for Virtual Private Network. It's a tool to extends a private network to external network environment to provide safe, private access. In practical reality the usage of this tool is embedded in complex situations, such as to circumvent state fire wall and bypass geographically restricted content. This project adopts a DIY working attitude. The underlying technology is provided by PiVPN, an open source free software that runs on a Raspberry Pi. As the Pi is connected to a home network, it's able to provide VPN access. I initiated this project as a response to my personal practical situation. As I live in the Netherlands, I travel back to China from time to time. The state fire wall blocks access to services such as Google, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram. My mail service is dependent on Gmail, I do watch YouTube for occasional "guilty pleasure", not to mention the tutorial I followed on how to set up PiVPN is from a YouTuber. Aside from services that are not blocked by the firewall, access to content sometimes also can be slow, due to more distant network traffic route.

      The following talk will address the recent calls for regulation of digital content on social media platforms alongside the digital emancipation movements of the 90's, and how this informs, or rather, elucidates issues in digital ethics. And by this I mean the way in which various normative claims exist, and persist online, and how such ethical conventions interact with us user-subjects. Ultimately, my plan is to show that there is a fundamental error in how digital ethics are understood, and that normative claims such as ‘free speech' appear to operate in a very distinct way online. This is the beginning of a greater project regarding the nature of ‘the digital self', and my plan is for this presentation to function as means of clarification, and identification of a problem. A problem which, I think can be attended to by social sciences, cultural theory & psychoanalysis.

      Relationships are fundamental to networked activity—as a kind of interpersonal infrastructure, feedback allows us to communicate our expectations and observations. Even with the proliferation of organizational frameworks to help us consider giving and receiving, our intentions can be clouded by biases, misaligned goals, and fraught relationships. If the only variable we can control is ourselves, how can we consciously act to depersonalize feedback and guide our colleagues to coach / evaluate us on the areas in which we need or hope to grow? What relevant methods or approaches could we borrow from design research? This workshop will open with a primer on existing feedback frameworks and models, then participants will work individually and collaboratively through a semi-structured activity to answer 'what could it look like to frame feedback as exploratory research into ourselves?

      Building decentralized websites using Beaker and Dat is fun--and a great, hands-on way to learn about the otherwise hidden structures and exchanges that power the web. But to do so, one--more so than ever--needs proficiency in the language of the web (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) in order to participate. In a workshop specifically for children and other 'outsiders', a modified version of 'Hotglue' is used to build decentralized sites together and interlink them. Hotglue is a FOSS 'What you see is what you get' editor for the web. Created in 2010, it currently uses files on the server it is installed to hold the users' data. A to-be-created modified branch of "Hotglue" would instead work on top of the Dat ecosystem, forgoing the need to be running a server altogether.

      In the Media Archaeology Lab my colleagues and I have the unique opportunity to experiment with 'obsolete' technologies, including networking protocols. Though they are outdated, these technologies provide a unique opportunity to experience a form of technological connection that is rarely available - direct, limited, and affectively more honest than the networks we've become accustomed to. My talk-shop will offer an overview of the projects currently running in the MAL in addition to getting hands-on with some ideas for building personalized, defiantly non-commercial networks with abandoned and retro technologies, from the slightly absurd to the potentially utilitarian.

      CoBox is a project to enable p2p cloud infrastructures with different trust-settings. The project emphasises privacy by design and easy data governance. The aim is to enable data commons, while protecting against the worst societal effects of dataification and data extraction. Many of the worst effects of Web 2.0 can be traced to the business models of the corporations that dominate the Internet: add-based and financialised businesses where services are paid through people's attention and click rate. This creates a number of devastating knock-on effects, including mass surveillance, design and development efforts aimed at creating addictive behaviours as well as information echo-chambers, phycological and emotional feedback loops. The consequences are ripping through the social fabric of societies and scorching the nervous systems of our bodies. Instead of a drive towards incorporating all interactions and behaviours into data centres for commercial exploitation, the emphasis of CoBox is to enable easy, yet conscious data governance where only the minimal necessary data is created and stored. What might be the new forms of organisations that would emerge from such an infrastructure? And conversely, which existing forms of organisations, networks and companies might benefit from such infrastructures? And critically - through which kinds of economic arrangements might a cooperative p2p cloud sustain itself in the long term?

      Bret Victor posed an important question: over a long time horizon, what strategy for preserving information has been most successful? Redundant copies stored in a distributed way (for example, each of us storing a full copy of the human genome) or a centralized repository (like the Library of Alexandria)? For the last few years, I've been working on a project to pull a copy of my personal history from across all the platforms and tools I use and make it available for archiving, search, and computation. I'd like to go over the historical project that inspired this project (the Memex of 1945) as well as giving a demo of the system I've built.

      A collaborative drawing-based discussion between activists, hackers, technologists and researchers on how we can imagine a radically different, better, internet. Participants will be encouraged to produce drawings (individually and in groups) that represent how they imagine the internet to be now and how they would like the internet to be in the future. The drawings will support a discussion on how to imagine radically different technological futures. The unusual format of the discussion allows for the inclusion of people with different types of expertise and experiences of technology, thus helping to break down the technical barriers that are often involved in talking about infrastructures.

    description: >
      A sculpture is material form in real space, this is its most basic quality; a network is a form in both real and "real" space. When we see sculpture, it reveals itself slowly through our visual experience of its form, weight, material, place, volume, mass, amongst other characteristics. Networks, on the other hand, are harder to see, especially when you are in them - but they still have these same properties. Viewing a sculpture is like viewing the culmination of several moments in time. They are collections of choices and physicalizations of priorities. Every detail is a decision and analysing a sculpture reveals its decision tree. In this talk, I will propose that networks can disclose themselves in the same way, if we ask the same questions.

      <Torrents of Sex> is one of the projects of Nahee.app, web-based performance project about sex and network technology. Assuming that someday human can upload and download their somatic sensations onto the web, Nahee.app designed peer-to-peer polyamorous sexual relationship network protocol <Torrents of Sex>, inspired by BitTorrent’s file distribution & peer selection algorithms. In this project, I regard myself as a web application having sexual desire and speculate what would happen if that programmable entity can have sexual relationships as we do. With their programmability which is the biggest difference of <Nahee.app> from real human, <Nahee.app> approaches technology as a tool for redefining ingrained ways of having sexual relationship

    description: >
      'Decentralization' has emerged as a rallying cry to build a web where control is delegated away from central authorities and toward individuals. However, among the multitude of efforts to decentralize the web, there is a lack of consensus on how it should occur and what new centres of power will be cultivated in the process. This talk traces decentralization through historical accounts of the development of the Internet, highlighting how architectural decentralization has served multiple dimensions of social and cultural power. It then discusses how two recent projects reimagine web culture and inscribe new values through the design of socio-technical systems. This analysis offers tools for researchers and designers to think beyond mere decentralization and more substantively engage with their social and epistemic commitments in the design of future internets.

      Video presentation by Farhad Bahram, accompanying the exhibited artwork: Made in Iran. Made in Iran is the outcome of several interviews with 12 Iranian individuals, living in the United States, whose lives are affected by the travel ban. Throughout this conversation they portrayed how, as the result of recent feuds between the two countries, their identities are often assumed by others to only comprise their nationality. In this project I tried to portray their complexity, depth and presence by interviewing them and asking them to share in a series of words, images and videos that more accurately reflects their intended identity.

      Video presentation by Biyi Wen, accompanying the exhibited artwork: Channel channel, a network for VPN access. Channel Channel is a project that involves around the basic usage, access and further social dynamics of VPN, which stands for Virtual Private Network. It's a tool to extends a private network to external network environment to provide safe, private access. In practical reality the usage of this tool is embedded in complex situations, such as to circumvent state fire wall and bypass geographically restricted content. This project adopts a DIY working attitude. The underlying technology is provided by PiVPN, an open source free software that runs on a Raspberry Pi. As the Pi is connected to a home network, it's able to provide VPN access. I initiated this project as a response to my personal practical situation. As I live in the Netherlands, I travel back to China from time to time. The state fire wall blocks access to services such as Google, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram. My mail service is dependent on Gmail, I do watch YouTube for occasional "guilty pleasure", not to mention the tutorial I followed on how to set up PiVPN is from a YouTuber. Aside from services that are not blocked by the firewall, access to content sometimes also can be slow, due to more distant network traffic route.

For three weeks, we will explore playful and experimental ways of communicating with each another over the peer to peer network. As a means to think beyond the standardized social media of the Web 2.0, we will work on customizing our own chatroom interfaces by integrating features such as collaborative drawing and simple animations. In this current iteration of creating on the web, we have to become more inclusive, collaborative, and considerate not only on how we hold a space but also on where we build the space.

More specifically, I am utilizing feet (both figuratively and literally) as a unit of measurement to navigate through my grandmother's, my mother's, and then my own home. Every carpet, rug, wood panel, tile and floor covering is meticulously measured, as I pace each inch with my feet. As I walked these homes, the floor plans become permanently ingrained in my memory, inch by inch, solidifying the connection between my family and I, no matter the distance. Each home segment can be seen as a parallel world to where I currently am; and reminds me that my past and present will always be a part of me heading into the future.

    This talk begins from the premise that today’s social computing environments--their interfaces, data structures, and overall designs--have been enormously, if latently, influenced by philosophy. Machine learning strategies for computer vision and automatic classification owe a conceptual debt to Humean empiricism, for example. Embodied interaction design is deeply indebted to the insights of Heideggerean phenomenology. And the ideas of American pragmatist and logician Charles Sanders Peirce serve as an important formalizing basis for networked data structures.

    This is a proposal for a decentralized exercice de style, inspired by [Oulipo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo). The idea is to create a literary mesh. This literary game is played in two rounds: the writing and the rewriting. First, I will write a short (1 paragraph) family-friendly story, and suggests different themes (styles) to then rewrite this short story in. The original story will be published in a GitHub repo, and each theme will have an issue.

    Filmed in a computer Lab, Internet Aerobics is a 20-minute aerobics workout routine about the internet, streaming to you through the internet. Aerobics props of long, blue ethernet cables are used, and hyperlink blue is celebrated as the color of online opportunity -- of links that have not yet been clicked. Aerobics moves embody multiple facets of online life, with packets of information speeding through wifi networks, routers, data centers, fiber optic cables -- often times at different speeds due to the lack of net neutrality laws. This workout routine is an invitation to you to sweat along in front of your own browser tab while thinking about and moving through the very makeup of the Internet, itself.

    Routing protocols are all around you. Through a mess of radio waves, electrical signals, and flickering light, routing protocols determine how information gets from point A to point B. There are lots of analogies out there for how routing protocols work (think postal service p.s. SAVE the USPS!) and there are more routing protocols shooting around the interwebs than you may realize. But what if you don't want to use the traditional, (big I)nternet? What if your medium of communication is something so new and cutting edge, or so retro and outdated (let's call it vintage) that the commonly used standards don't apply. Or what if you just want to better understand how information moves through cyberspace? Where would you start?! You would start by building your own routing protocol.

All utopias, archistic or not equals the intended elimination of uncertainty because their aim is to end history and hence uncertainty.

    Learn about the 7 key challenges that hinder the adoption of decentralized applications
    Deep-dive into design and developer onboarding & naming. How do we name things across the ecosystem? Where does terminology help or hinder understanding across different protocols and applications? What are appropriate metaphors and descriptions for different user groups?
    Where can we converge on particular names for key concepts? How would we go about creating a common glossary?

    _Eigengrau_ (a term used to describe what is seen through closed eyes) is a web-based artwork that facilitates a sense of connection with others while resisting the rapid cognitive pace demanded by dominant social media platforms. It is a platform that can only be interacted with when users close their eyes. Using socket.io and p5js, an in-browser facial feature tracker detects when a participant's eyes are closed, at which point, an audible tone is generated. When multiple users visit the site and close their eyes simultaneously, harmonized tones are produced for each user and broadcast across the network, resulting in a collectively played organ.

In this way, biton can be used for evading information controls and for building community networks around local data and services.

  description: >
    The last fifteen years has seen a surge of interest in decentralised technology. From well-funded blockchain projects like IPFS to the emergence of large scale information networks such as Dat, Scuttlebutt and ActivityPub, this is renewed life in peer-to-peer technologies; a renaissance that enjoys widespread growth, driven by the desire for platform commons and community self-determination. These are goals that are fundamentally at odds with – and a response to – the incumbent platforms of social media, music and movie distribution and data storage. As we enter the 2020s, centralised power and decentralised communities are on the verge of outright conflict for the control of the digital public space. The resilience of centralised networks and the political organisation of their owners remains significantly underestimated by protocol activists. At the same time, the decentralised networks and the communities they serve have never been more vulnerable. The peer-to-peer community is dangerously unprepared for a crisis-fuelled future that has very suddenly arrived at their door.

    Craft practices rely on the exchange and transmission of techniques, technical skills, tacit and explicit knowledge about materials and methods but also on the circulation of common values and ethos, fostering shared mindsets and communities. Many of these communities around the world are developing and passing on these technical and cultural legacies to fellow practitioners, creating cultural and intellectual commons in the same movement, by organizing autonomous conferences, camps, short residency programs, and working collaboratively bringing local and international networks together. This session proposes to bring several of these practitioners together to discuss what their practices create beyond artifacts, and how they contribute to establishing self-determined communities and to fostering commons.

    Listening Space is an artistic research that explores transmission ecologies as a means of perceiving the surrounding environment beyond our human abilities. Conceptually the project seeks to define transmissions ecologies as raw material for artistic expression, to understand and re-imagine in poetic means, representations of audio and images broadcasted from space. The artists are creating cyber physical systems for sensing the invisible universe that surrounds us. By using open-source tools, DIY electronics, hardware hacking and digital crafts, they aim to approach art and science and create artifacts that explore the idea of citizen science. Specifically, by focusing on electromagnetic-field (EMF) and radio frequency (RF) detection, they aim to re-claim the depth of transmission ecologies, evolving at a higher rhythm than liveness, through our environment and bodies.

Following an overview of the conceptual background, the duo will dive into how they merged performance art, facial recognition, an immersive contract, selfie stages, environmental sensors, and a score by Amon Tobin to create an audience experience that sheds light on the real price of being 'on view' in our current digital landscape. Ti and Catherine will then host a discussion about how art and technology can be harnessed to strategically, creatively, and ethically rebuild a healthier digital future.

Inspired by [Holistic Security](https://holistic-security.tacticaltech.org/) by [Tactical Tech](https://tacticaltech.org/) and the [Revolutionary Networked Politics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyeoTmgM6Uk) presentations [at transmediale](https://2020.transmediale.de/content/revolutionary-networked-politics), we will engage through a holistic approach that centres on self-care and the well-being of content authors. There are many topics relevant to digital publishing, such as: equitable compensations and dignified livelihoods, creative expression on moderated platforms, security and anonymity in online spaces. How does one navigate the complex environments and entrenched power structures of the web? What is the cost of the labour asked of an individual creator and the impact on their well-being?
