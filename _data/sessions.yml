    description: "Wireless Toronto is a community wireless network run by volunteers, dedicated to the growth of no-cost wireless Internet access in Toronto's public and publicly accessible spaces. Since the group's founding in May 2005, volunteers set up almost 40 hotspots across the GTA, including some of the city's largest: St. Lawrence Market, Yonge-Dundas Square, and the York Quay Centre at Harbourfront.
      At its peak, the network served over 1000 connections per day.
      For a variety of reasons, the Wireless Toronto network has shrunk over time, and today only a handful of nodes remain active. This presentation will outline the group's history, successes and learnings."

    description: "In this session, I will present Mesh Orange, a Debian-based router that runs on various single-board computers (SBCs), which together form an autonomous encrypted mesh network. The operating system supports various WiFi hardware and features a configuration system that allows local mesh communities to specify custom hardware settings. After walking through the steps to form a physical mesh network with Mesh Orange, we will run peer-to-peer applications on these SBCs to show a possible internet where networked applications are serviced by distributed protocols communicating over physical nodes arranged in a mesh topology."

      Blockchain is everywhere these days - from finance and law, to kitten-collecting, dating-apps, and ice tea companies. This workshop will explore what this technology offers, how it works, and what it can and cannot do in a friendly, playful setting. We will introduce the basics of how blockchains work in a short presentation, and then expand on them with a facilitated session of Scrabits, a modified version of scrabble based on the bitcoin blockchain. Concepts explored will be - what is a ledger, what are the unique challenges of maintaining a decentralized way, and how bitcoin solves these problems."

The urban development models of the past are beginning to fall short in creating cities that support the reality of our current existence. Networks aren’t just nodes and links designated by code—they are accessed and used by real people over physical infrastructure that exists in physical space. How does the network interface with the city, and with the public? What are the individual and collective experiences and interactions that are enabled by these networks in practice?"

    linkDisplay: "Ouinet"
    description: "Currently, most websites and apps depend on centralized servers despite the limitations of this structure. Migration towards P2P architectures may be encouraged by solutions which support the current centralized paradigm while taking advantage of P2P architectures, making apps more resilient to interference and letting users' devices empower the underlying P2P network. For that reason we created Ouinet, a technology where an entire cooperative network helps serve HTTP requests using P2P routing and distributed cached responses, mitigating the single point of failure due to client apps not being able to connect to the server.
      We will discuss the philosophy and design behind Ouinet, how we integrated various P2P technologies such as IPFS and I2P to achieve its objectives, and demonstrate how an alpha implementation can be integrated in Android apps to defy network interference while saving on server bandwidth and remote resources, as we shall also see during the sprints days."

    description: "As the internet evolves and changes, what material of the internet's past will continue to be available? What is being actively preserved for the future, and who is doing this work? In this session I'll discuss my doctoral research project that explores these questions through two cases studies of web archiving by national libraries and academic research libraries which are part of the International Internet Preservation Consortium. These cases are representative of the many web archiving initiatives and practices tied to existing centralized structures - supported by government and academic institutions, as well as methods of crawling tied to infrastructures like country code top-level domains. These institutional efforts can be seen to contrast with distributed communities like Archiveteam as well as activist and community web archives. And increasingly, individual people can also create and curate their own collections with tools like webrecorder.io that are geared towards users who are not coders."

Since July 2017, founding partners EDGI, qri.io, and Protocol Labs, have been prototyping open source and decentralized archiving of web pages and data sets using IPFS. Initiatives also include public engagement through in-person events and topical roundtable conversations through online webinars.
      This talk will speak to the tensions and successes in our early prototypes and address the values motivating our work."

    description: "The philosophers have only interpreted the internet, the point is to change it.
      IP, BGP, DNS, HTTP, and many more protocols set the boundaries of what we do on the internet. Their specifications and implementations have enabled many great advances, but some of these advances have revealed structures and mechanisms that are objectively counter to their users' needs and wants.
      Our communities are radical in many ways, and some of our shared principles are
      accessibility, ubiquity, sustainability, resilience, and impact.
      We'll look at effective tactics used by protocols, old and new, to achieve these principles."

    description: "The digital divide in Mexico is not just a matter of connectivity. The deployment of physical infrastructure must be coupled with a cultural, linguistic and community perspective, able to provide internet access as a way to exercise a wide range of rights. Article 19 Mexico and Central America office is doing field work in the state of Chiapas to analyze, from a broad perspective, the impact of connectivity policies and the lack to internet access on indigenous communities and the raising of local initiatives to build community networks. The project is linked to the work of the organization to promote proactive transparency that allows people, particularly women, to use access to information mechanisms to defend other rights.
      Sharing this experience is an opportunity, firstly to present preliminary results of the field work but also to generate significant links with other initiatives looking to consolidate long term projects in which communities play an active role to promote access to Internet, develop strategies for digital literacy and appropriate the use ICTs."

    description: "In the world we live in, there is a near-universal social norm that says greater connectivity, a more global web, and more pervasive digital networks are an inherent good. We see this sentiment reflected everywhere, from the obvious manifestations in IoT devices, cellphones, and Facebook, to more implicit forms, such as in the fights for greater digital security, more censorship-resistant communication, or more distributed control of these networks. As communities involved in shaping the future of these networks, and whose futures will in turn be shaped by them, it seems worth asking: Is a more networked world really always what we want?
      Rather than try to answer this question directly, we will instead provide a short introduction to the topic, then help guide an open discussion, focusing on what it means in practice for us involved in the development of these networks."

    description: "The interdisciplinary creative practices of fandom — whether it be fanfiction, fanart, or cosplay — challenge our previously held notions of authorship, but also uphold the open internet’s emancipatory values. Networked-based online creations thrive within particular fandoms, and its community-based model has enabled authors to create works that bring in feminist as well as queer and critical race studies approaches, especially through genres like slash. So how are these fan methodologies reshaping the practices of artists and curators? This conversation will map out the ways in which three “fans” AKA contemporary artists/curators are bringing these so-called fan perspectives into their work, and explore how fandom cultivates alternative means of capacity-building and storytelling."

    description: "Although we access internet from many locations acoss our communications, our expectations for connectivity and availability of content are somewhat more static. In these moments our experience of the networked connectivity is embedded in not only files and bandwidth, but also mixes the activities of passerby and environmental features. Our ways of accessing information (i.e. files, content, etc) could be significantly diversified in networks without ubiquitous (centrally provided) broadband, where access might be linked to the physical environment or physical storage, such as in dead drops or Cuba's budding public wifi access or their 'sneakernet' style paquete semanal.
      What might happen when network connectivity works differently in shared spaces of transit, leisure and work? What are the possible benefits of challenging the expectation of ubiquitous broadband and the cadence of constant connectivity- the what ethical issues might arise? Can we create different sorts of networks that fit the constraints and character of different spaces and human activities around them?"

      This talk begins from a seemingly simple cultural historical premise: that the Net Art/Anti-Globalism movement theories of data-bodies, new forms of civil disobedience, and the performative matrix of artist networks between virtual and real spaces were formed under pre-digital conditions and artistic practices based in the intermedia movement. More importantly, I argue that pre-digital practices of the artist communications infrastructure as both network and counterinstitution--derived from media revolutions of the underground press, conceptual and process art practices of social sculpture, and working class progressivist artist workers movements of the 20th century--allowed for counterhegemonic deterritorializations and reterritorializations of emergent media networks and resources. These intermedia cultural movements prioritized hybrid ontologies and adapted tactically from the pre-digital to digital cusp through media ecologies of electronic globalization characterizing neoliberal mobility and modularity."

    description: "The ongoing discussion about decentralisation has been dominated by the talk of blockchains lately. While they do work in certain fields, in social networks the bottleneck and restrictions imposed by the distributed consensus render it challenging to build a social network on a blockchain that does not suffer from speed issues.
      This talk explores a different way of building networks that does not depend on distributed consensus. By making a small number of tradeoffs, it is possible to build a network that can scale to 10^3x the speed in inserting new data and distributing it. Aether is one such attempt, and both it and the underlying protocol is open source. This talk will focus on how it ended up coming to be, why, and how it works, and what you can build with the underlying protocol."

Then why wonder how came our engineers are mostly building centralized client-server data silos, if in the core of their curriculums usually lies a mental model of computing from 70s, with a singular mainframe being programmed and used from multiple "dumb" terminals. And then history replicates itself, and modern-day Facebook uses our multi-GHz, multi-GB, multi-core devices as dumb terminals of sorts. Let's see what tools and approaches are there at your command, if you decide to build something else, something more decentralized, more resilient, frequently more performant and bringing agency back to end users"

      "Workers' rights are losing respect, the power of technology is not fully understood – gone are the eras of strength of 1940s US labor unions. A financial environment cushioned by unregulated laws created an orange-coloured disease, Amazon, that systemically targets poor people, Black communities and communities of color. It spreads precarity as a contagion, strengthens digital redlining, and produces predatory surveillance: Amazon, the company, has changed the world. Also, it has changed the word. Amazon will come to solely signify the company and not the Brazilian rainforest. I will speak on the 'Amazonification' of the world and its role in spreading neoliberal ecoterrorism by remapping environmental scarcity as precarity onto vulnerable populations. I will connect this to the company’s predatory system of surveillance through its in-house facial recognition software and serving as the tech-backbone of ICE. Through the innocuous frame of consumption, this talk and screening decrypts the 'success' behind corporate rendering of workers' labor as invisible and through its AI algorithms extending the carceral state."

      "This presentation investigates the idea of affirmative negation, which examines the condition of creative production as an exception to the regular laws of an existing situation; or as Nietzsche calls it, negation of the status quo. Affirmative negation suggests that indicative message of a communicative act is not necessarily embedded within a set of utterances and wordings as such, but it could, paradoxically, be found in the negation of these superficial manifestations. Using this concept, I will talk about my current research, through a series of projects about the relationship between identity and social interaction. Mirroring the rich, interdependent, and shape-shifting world we live in, I suggest that our sense of self is increasing in complexity and changing throughout our lifetime. This particular project, called Made in Iran, is the outcome of several interviews with Iranian individuals, living in the United States, whose identities are often assumed by others to only comprise their nationality. In this work I tried to portray their complexity, depth and presence by asking them to share in a series of words, images and videos that more accurately reflects their intended identity."

      "Will design ethics save design? As the broader design community becomes increasingly uncomfortable with the structures and clients it serves, a growing movement seeks to integrate ethics into design practice. But this prioritises individual decisions and values over critical analysis of socio-political and economic outcomes. The pop discourse that calls for ethics indemnifies designers and obfuscates the inherent problems of their work, resulting in the celebration of projects that at their core problematic, such as digital wellness, decentralised systems, autonomous cars and inclusive facial recognition. Building on the essay “On Weaponised Design,” and an ongoing multi-year research and practice project with Tactical Tech and others, Design Ethics? No Thanks explores how design has enabled a decade of absurdity and examine how design ethics threatens to neutralise both the critique of outcomes and the potential contribution of design to a radically reimagined world."

The distributed web is actually a lot easier to work with that you might expect, and doesn't require any "back end" experience. Dat is a P2P protocol that makes it easy to share and update files over a Peer To Peer network. What's more, people can create websites with it directly from a web browser. This workshop will walk people through publishing their first P2P website using Dat and some retro-feeling HTML. Bring your laptop or phone and expect garish colors, obnoxious GIFs, and the <marquee> element."

We will look into implementations / realisations of decentralised festivals and talk about how they influenced our way of discussing and producing art and technology.

      "As resistance to state control continues to grow, states are reacting by tightening the restrictions on the flow of information surrounding these uprisings and protests. One of the main tools at their disposal is to leverage their control over centralized Internet infrastructure to block access to news sites, social media, and content that threaten their authority. Tor Project is working on a way to circumvent these restrictions on information. This talk will describe a way we can collectively fight back by hosting P2P proxies in our browsers to share our agency with others. Snowflake is a new censorship circumvention tool that relies on the participation of many to further widen the cracks in state-imposed Internet firewalls."

    description: "This paper proposes information technology (IT) infrastructure is formulating a universal language. It dips into historic efforts to create a universal language via avant garde filmmaking and Gottfried Leibniz’s characteristica universalis. It then explains how international standardization organizations are developing the globally unified infrastructural language through their regulations. The paper weighs the benefits and consequences of a universal language by looking into who IT infrastructure serves and who is excluded. As Marshall McLuhan inferred in his 1964 essay, “The Medium is the Message,” technology becomes inseparable from the messages it transmits, adding another layer of meaning to what is communicated; language, in turn, starts to be shaped around the tools that facilitate it. Thus, IT infrastructure is not just a tool to communicate, but is part of language itself."

      "Channel Channel is a project that involves around the basic usage, access and further social dynamics of VPN, which stands for Virtual Private Network. It's a tool to extends a private network to external network environment to provide safe, private access. In practical reality the usage of this tool is embedded in complex situations, such as to circumvent state fire wall and bypass geographically restricted content. This project adopts a DIY working attitude. The underlying technology is provided by PiVPN, an open source free software that runs on a Raspberry Pi. As the Pi is connected to a home network, it's able to provide VPN access. I initiated this project as a response to my personal practical situation. As I live in the Netherlands, I travel back to China from time to time. The state fire wall blocks access to services such as Google, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram. My mail service is dependent on Gmail, I do watch YouTube for occasional "guilty pleasure", not to mention the tutorial I followed on how to set up PiVPN is from a YouTuber. Aside from services that are not blocked by the firewall, access to content sometimes also can be slow, due to more distant network traffic route."

And by this I mean the way in which various normative claims exist, and persist online, and how such ethical conventions interact with us user-subjects. Ultimately, my plan is to show that there is a fundamental error in how digital ethics are understood, and that normative claims such as ‘free speech’ appear to operate in a very distinct way online. This is the beginning of a greater project regarding the nature of ‘the digital self’, and my plan is for this presentation to function as means of clarification, and identification of a problem. A problem which, I think can be attended to by social sciences, cultural theory & psychoanalysis."

Even with the proliferation of organizational frameworks to help us consider giving and receiving, our intentions can be clouded by biases, misaligned goals, and fraught relationships. If the only variable we can control is ourselves, how can we consciously act to depersonalize feedback and guide our colleagues to coach / evaluate us on the areas in which we need or hope to grow? What relevant methods or approaches could we borrow from design research? This workshop will open with a primer on existing feedback frameworks and models, then participants will work individually and collaboratively through a semi-structured activity to answer “what could it look like to frame feedback as exploratory research into ourselves?"

But to do so, one--more so than ever--needs proficiency in the language of the web (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) in order to participate. In a workshop specifically for children and other 'outsiders', a modified version of 'Hotglue' is used to build decentralized sites together and interlink them. Hotglue is a FOSS 'What you see is what you get' editor for the web. Created in 2010, it currently uses files on the server it is installed to hold the users' data. A to-be-created modified branch of "Hotglue" would instead work on top of the Dat ecosystem, forgoing the need to be running a server altogether."
