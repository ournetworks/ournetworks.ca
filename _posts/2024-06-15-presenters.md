Over the course of a day we will cover the PAST, PRESENT, and FUTURE of our networks, and we are excited to announce a couple of the presenters guiding us through each period:
- [Lori Emerson](https://loriemerson.net/), [@loriemerson@post.lurk.org](https://post.lurk.org/@loriemerson) will speak about [other networks](https://othernetworks.net/) outside of what is now called "the internet"
- [Joni Schinkel](https://jschinkel.com/) at [Small File Media Festival](https://smallfile.ca), will workshop approaches to small footprint web art

More presenters will be announced soon, but you don't have to wait! Register for [#ournetworks](https://post.lurk.org/tags/ournetworks) today (sliding scale $30-120): [ournetworks.ca#register](https://ournetworks.ca/#register)
