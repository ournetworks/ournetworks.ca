**RE: Infrastructures** explores the collective care and maintenance of alternative networking practicesâ€”new protocols, peer-to-peer connections, offline-first computing, and community-based governance. 

How can these emerging **Infrastructures of <span class="word"></span>** provide spaces to imagine<span class="word-spacer"></span>  
radically different futures, resist easy co-option by the forces of late-stage capitalism, and work in solidarity as plural networks seeking emancipatory change? To answer this we draw on insights from organizers, technologists, artists, and scholars to ensure the focus is not only on the technical aspects of infrastructure, but also the social and cultural. Their diverse perspectives suggest ways we can make space for livelihoods, solidarity, and survival; draw on history and place to bring our fullest imaginations to this moment; and open ways to think these questions together as we build transitional forms.

This year has a mix of scheduled talks and workshops alongside open space, as well as screenings, a zine library, and an art exhibition. Topics include:

- Practices of reparative networking
- Remediation practices for communication infrastructures
- Uncooptable computing reconfigurations
- Reconstructing technology after refusal
- Regenerative approaches that resist status quo tech
