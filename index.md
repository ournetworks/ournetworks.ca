Drawing inspiration from our favourite sci-fi authors we’re headed to a future for Our Networks ~~2022~~ 2047. Join us over two weeks to call into the present an artefact from an Our Networks more than 20 years ahead. We will collectively narrate the history of the steps that allowed us to get there from here in order to understand where and how we can focus ourselves in the present.

We've all been living through these weeks where decades happen. Looking back on our past we find neither dystopia nor utopia. Instead, our history winds in-between, with setbacks and sudden leaps toward the internet and web we want. In order to even try and get there we’ve had to fight to transform the entire world. While there have been great strides in remaking where we live, work, and play as we tackle the interleaved crises of climate, capitalism, and co-option. There are still looming challenges and lingering concerns. 

For an event that has been held alongside these struggles, Our Networks has been a place to share victories and defeats together. Out of [a sense of large-scale ruin &#10548;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Noise_(novel)), we have kept inventing hope, the kind that isn’t optimism, but rather [a discipline we practice every single day &#10548;](https://towardfreedom.org/story/archives/activism/hope-is-a-discipline/). In 2047 it feels like we are at another critical juncture, just like we were in 2022 and 2035.

So once again, what will we make of our futures? How do we learn from our pasts? How do we extend the forms of redistribution and accountability in the spaces, movements, collectives, and institutions that have been our inspirations and homes for the last few decades?

We’re excited to announce our keynote speakers, check back for more details closer to the event:

Please Note: We are not hosting a conference, but instead facilitating the creation of a wiki about a conference that could take place in 2047. 

Between November 14–27, 2022 we will host a series of online writeathons where we will facilitate contributions and co-writing on to the 2047 wiki. To join us during the writeathons, all you need is an internet connection. You will also be able to edit the wiki fully asynchronously. All events are free, and registration will stay open during the writing period.

## FAQ
{:.authentic-condensed-60}

**How will the event take place?**  
{:.mb-05}
There is no conference. The call is to invite people to contribute to a wiki (set in 2047) about a conference (that is happening in this sci-fi future). We'll be hosting a series of writathons during November 14–27, 2022, but async contributions will be possible too. After Nov we will produce some swag (stickers, maybe a poster) inspired by the wiki writings to send out by post to people who registered.

**Is the event online or IRL?**  
{:.mb-05}
All participation will happen asynchronously or live at online writeathons during November 14–27!

**Are you actually going to host a conference in 2047?**  

No. Maybe you could though 🌠

**To "submit a character's name and bio" – should I submit as myself, my future self, or a totally new character from the future? (or any of the above?)**  
{:.mb-05}
Any of the above! You could write a talk you'd like to imagine your real self giving in 2047, or create a character, or create many characters!

**Is the "artefact" the conference? Or will we create a different kind of artefact to capture a conference from the future?**  
{:.mb-05}
The artefact will be related to the wiki we collectively contribute to during the conference period of November 14–27, 2022. After November, we will produce a physical record (maybe stickers, maybe a poster) inspired by the wiki writings to send out by post to people who registered.
