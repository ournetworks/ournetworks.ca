**COVID-19 and Our Networks 2020**—We've been closely monitoring (as we're sure you all have) the situation via [Toronto Public Health](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/diseases-medications-vaccines/coronavirus/) and [Ontario Ministry of Health](https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus). Recent announcements from the Canadian government include travel advisories for everyone arriving from outside the country. The situation is rapidly evolving and we can assume a lot will change between now and when we had scheduled Our Networks 2020 in August. However, what we can anticipate is the disruptions and aftershocks from the pandemic will continue for months.

We firmly believe that for us to responsibly proceed we have to do more than consider whether to cancel; at a time when the topics we come together to imagine are more pressing than ever, what are our obligations—how can emerging decentralized infrastructures support radically different futures? how do alternative networks work in solidarity for change? what tactices of collective care and maintenance help us respond the opportunities and challenges of this moment?

Be assured, we're plotting a course for Our Networks 2020 to continue. As we proceed we also want to hear your thoughts, concerns, and hopes for how we can strengthen our networks in uncertain times. 

Please don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
