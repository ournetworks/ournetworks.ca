Our Networks 2019 explores the collective care and maintenance of alternative networking practicesâ€”whether those practices are new protocols, peer-to-peer, offline-first, or community-based governance and ownership. How can these emerging **Infrastructures of ...** provide spaces to imagine radically different futures, resist easy co-option by the forces of late-stage capitalism, and work in solidarity as plural networks seeking emancipatory change?

Building on last year, where we asked how to move beyond solitary practices of do it yourself (DIY), in 2019 we explore what critical and creative practices offer **RE: Infrastructures** of alternatives. We draw on insight from organizers, technologists, artists, and scholars to ensure the focus is not only on the technical aspects of infrastructure, but also the social and cultural. These diverse perspectives explore how to make space for livelihoods, solidarity, and survival; draw on history and place to bring our fullest imaginations to this moment; and think these questions together as we build transitional forms.
