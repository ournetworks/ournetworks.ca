_Drawing inspiration from our favourite sci-fi authors we’re headed to a future for Our Networks ~~2022~~ 2047. Join us over two weeks to call into the present an artefact from an Our Networks more than 20 years ahead. We will collectively narrate the history of the steps that allowed us to get there from here in order to understand where and how we can focus ourselves in the present._

We've all been living through these weeks where decades happen. Looking back on our past we find neither dystopia nor utopia. Instead, our history winds a inbetween the two, with setbacks and sudden leaps toward the internet and web we want. In order to get there we’ve had to fight to transform the entire world. Today, that work is not over, and while there have been great strides in remaking where we live, work, and play as we tackle the climate crisis, there are still looming challenges and lingering concerns. 

For an event that has been held alongside these struggles. Our Networks has been a place to share both victories and defeats together. Out of a pervading sense of large-scale ruin, we must keep inventing hope. But the kind of hope that isn’t optimism, rather the hope that is a discipline, one we practice every single day. In 2047 it feels like we are at another critical juncture, just like we were in 2022 and 2035. 

So once again, what will we make of our futures? How do we learn from our pasts? How do we strengthen and extend our forms of redistribution and accountability in our spaces, movements, collectives, and institutions that have been our inspiration and home the last decades? 

_To participate all you need is an internet connection to join us during the event annotating the wiki of this future conference._

_We are seeking session leaders to spend at minimum a couple hours writing abstracts and pitches for the hypothetical conference programming. To declare your interest, please submit a character's name and bio, area of interest or talk by **August 15, 2022** here: [URL] (we have a template with prompts and examples to help you). A week before the event we will share instructions and a registration form for those who want to receive a material artefact from the future after the event. If you don't want to "lead a session", you can still participate: registration for wiki-editors will stay open until the event ends._
