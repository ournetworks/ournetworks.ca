_Drawing inspiration from our favourite sci-fi authors we’re headed to a future for Our Networks ~~2022~~ 2047. Join us over two weeks to call into the present an artefact from an Our Networks more than 20 years ahead. We will collectively narrate the history of the steps that allowed us to get there from here in order to understand where and how we can focus ourselves in the present._

We've all been living through these weeks where decades happen. Looking back on our past we find neither dystopia nor utopia. Instead, our history winds in-between, with setbacks and sudden leaps toward the internet and web we want. In order to even try and get there we’ve had to fight to transform the entire world. While there have been great strides in remaking where we live, work, and play as we tackle the interleaved crises of climate, capitalism, and co-option. There are still looming challenges and lingering concerns. 

For an event that has been held alongside these struggles, Our Networks has been a place to share victories and defeats together. Out of [a sense of large-scale ruin &#10548;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Noise_(novel)), we have kept inventing hope, the kind that isn’t optimism, but rather [a discipline we practice every single day &#10548;](https://towardfreedom.org/story/archives/activism/hope-is-a-discipline/). In 2047 it feels like we are at another critical juncture, just like we were in 2022 and 2035.

So once again, what will we make of our futures? How do we learn from our pasts? How do we strengthen and extend our forms of redistribution and accountability in our spaces, movements, collectives, and institutions that have been our inspiration and home the last decades? 

_To participate all you need is an internet connection to join us during the event annotating the wiki of this future conference._

_We are seeking session leaders to spend at minimum a couple hours writing abstracts and pitches for the hypothetical conference programming. To declare your interest, please submit a character's name and bio, area of interest or talk by **October 15, 2022** [here as a GitHub issue](https://github.com/ournetworks/2022-submissions/issues/new?template=submission.md&title=%5BSubmission+Title%5D) (we have a template with prompts to help you). A week before the event we will share instructions and a registration form for those who want to receive a material artefact from the future after the event. If you don't want to "lead a session", you can still participate: registration for wiki-editors will stay open until the event ends. The event is going to be between November 14 - 27, 2022._
