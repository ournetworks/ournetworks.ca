_Drawing inspiration from our favourite sci-fi authors we’re headed to a future for Our Networks ~~2022~~ 2047. Join us over two weeks to call into the present an artefact from an Our Networks more than 20 years ahead. We will collectively narrate the history of the steps that allowed us to get there from here in order to understand where and how we can focus ourselves in the present._

The last year has been full of weeks where decades happen. Looking back on our past we find neither dystopia nor utopia. Instead, our history winds a complicated inbetween with setbacks and leaps toward the internet and web we want. In order to get there we’ve had to fight to transform the entire world. Today, that work is not over, and while there have been great strides in remaking where we live, work, and play as we tackle the climate crisis, there are still looming challenges and lingering concerns. 

For an event that has been held alongside these struggles. Our Networks has been a place to share both victories and defeats together. Out of a pervading sense of large-scale ruin, we must keep inventing hope. But the kind of hope that isn’t optimism, rather the hope that is a discipline, one we practice every single day. In 2047 it feels like we are at another critical juncture, just like we were in 2022 and 2035.
