We strive to reduce barriers that would prevent people from participating and is current as of August 2019.

If you require interpretation, supervised childcare, or have any other access needs or questions, please contact [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}), ideally two weeks in advance.

## Moving

Toronto Media Arts Centre has a [policy on accessibility](https://policies.tomediaarts.org/procedure-manual/policies/accessibility) and detailing information about the building.

The event takes place in on the second floor, accessible via an elevator just inside the entrance. The main space is the Mezzanine, as well as Gamma Space and the Gatherspace.

The event space is barrier-free and during the event we will have an access lane marked off by tape to ensure passage to each area is not blocked off (Inspired by [AdaCamp's Access Lanes](https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/access-lanes/) and [WisCon's Blue Zone](http://wiscon.net/policies/accessibility/)).

The second floor has a private accessible washroom and an all-gender washroom with two accessible stalls.
