We strive to reduce barriers that would prevent people from participating and is current as of August 2019.

If you have any other access needs or questions, please contact [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}), ideally two weeks in advance.

## Childcare 

We will have a dedicated childminder based on stated need and children under 12 are free to attend! Please let us know by Saturday morning if you require childcare assistance.

## Presentations 

In order to make the presentations more accessible, we have included suggestions for speakers include things like: using high-contrast slides with large fonts, using short-form links for any URLS, and providing a digital or hard copy for people to follow along. If presenters would like to provide hard copies of materials the organizers can assist with printing. Speakers and Q&A sessions in the Main Room will have microphones and amplified sound.

## Venue

Toronto Media Arts Centre has a [policy on accessibility](https://policies.tomediaarts.org/procedure-manual/policies/accessibility) and detailing information about the building.

The event takes place on the second floor, accessible via an elevator just inside the entrance. The main space is the Mezzanine, as well as Gamma Space and the Gathering space.

The event space is barrier-free and during the event we will have an access lane marked off by tape to ensure passage to each area is not blocked off (Inspired by [AdaCamp's Access Lanes](https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/access-lanes/) and [WisCon's Blue Zone](http://wiscon.net/policies/accessibility/)).

The second floor has a private accessible washroom and an all-gender washroom with two accessible stalls.
