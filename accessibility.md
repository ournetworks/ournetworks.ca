For presentations we ask speakers to consider the following suggestions to enhance the accessibility of any slides: 
- use high-contrast slides with large fonts 
- use short-form links for any URLs
- provide a digital copy for people to follow along 

If you would like to provide hard copies of materials the organizers can assist with printing, just let us know in advance of your talk.
