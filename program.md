## Writeathons
{:.authentic-condensed-60.mt-2}

Between November 14–27, 2022 we will host a series of online writeathons where we will facilitate contributions and co-writing on to the 2047 wiki. To join us during the writeathons, all you need is an internet connection. You will also be able to edit the wiki fully asynchronously. All events are free, and registration will stay open during the writing period.

There will be four writeathons open to the public and loosely based around the key themes that inspired our call:

<div class="events-grid flex flex-wrap mb-1">
  {% for call in site.data.events %}
    <div class="event w-100 p-1 bg-black">
      {% include event.html event=call %}
    </div>
  {% endfor %}
</div>

Please let us know any access requirements you have for attending: [orga@ournetworks.ca](mailto:orga@ournetworks.ca)

## FAQ
{:.authentic-condensed-60.mt-2}

**How will the event take place?**  
{:.mb-05}
There is no conference. The call is to invite people to contribute to a wiki (set in 2047) about a conference (that is happening in this sci-fi future). We'll be hosting a series of writathons during November 14–27, 2022, but async contributions will be possible too. After Nov we will produce some swag (stickers, maybe a poster) inspired by the wiki writings to send out by post to people who registered.

**Is the event online or IRL?**  
{:.mb-05}
All participation will happen asynchronously or live at online writeathons during November 14–27!

**Are you actually going to host a conference in 2047?**  

No. Maybe you could though 🌠

**To "submit a character's name and bio" – should I submit as myself, my future self, or a totally new character from the future? (or any of the above?)**  
{:.mb-05}
Any of the above! You could write a talk you'd like to imagine your real self giving in 2047, or create a character, or create many characters!

**Is the "artefact" the conference? Or will we create a different kind of artefact to capture a conference from the future?**  
{:.mb-05}
The artefact will be related to the wiki we collectively contribute to during the conference period of November 14–27, 2022. After November, we will produce a physical record (maybe stickers, maybe a poster) inspired by the wiki writings to send out by post to people who registered.
