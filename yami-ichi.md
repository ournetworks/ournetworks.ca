Calling all vendors of internet-ish things— be prepared to gather and exchange goods from the backstreets of the Internet on {{ page.startDate | date: '%B %d, %Y' }} afternoon into evening. What's a Yami-ichi you ask?

<blockquote>
  S*%t happens. Didn't used to. Like when some small off-handed private comment
  turns into an SNS flame war. Or worrying about not getting enough “Likes”. The
  Youtube videos you can't watch anymore because somebody complained. Or the apps
  you can't play because they were rejected by Apple. Once upon a time, the
  Internet was supposed to be a place for "liberty". Nowadays it's so uptight.

  So let's turn off, log-out, and drop in, on the real world. The Internet
  Yami-Ichi is a flea market for “browsing” face-to-face.

  Take your own Internet liberties* here, with us.

  * But no dangerous or illegal goods, please! This black market wants to remain
  free and useful!
