**If you are not feeling well, please stay home and please let us know**: we have a care package we will send to you!

In addition, we encourage all attendees to:
- wear a high-quality mask during the event
- be up to date on COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters
- take a rapid test before attending the event
- get a rapid test from us if they feel unwell or experience symptoms during the event

We are planning the following steps:
- Have a CO<sub>2</sub> monitor in the main room we will be using
- Have 3 air purifiers in the rooms we will be using
- Have extra KN95 and N95 masks, hand sanitizer, and rapid tests available for all attendees at registration

We are looking at the following sites for information on COVID-19 in the province: Provincial Health Officer's page on [COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-issues/covid-19-novel-coronavirus) and [COVID-19 Resources Canada](https://covid19resources.ca/).
