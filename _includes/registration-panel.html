We have three admission levels: Organization Supporter, Supporter, and Reduced Cost. While the cost for us to host this event is $78 per person, we want to ensure all can attend. We are looking for volunteers (in return for complimentary admission) and are able to offer a limited number of scholarships, please contact us at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }})

| Admission              | Price* | Details |
|:-----------------------|:------|:--------|
| Organization Supporter | $110 | If your org or company is paying or your registration can be reimbursed, consider registering as organization supporter. This allows us to offer reduced cost admissions and scholarships. |
| Supporter              | $60 | The suggested admission for those employed or otherwise financially comfortable. At this rate we can sustain the event. |
