## Getting Around 

Toronto is easily navigable by bike ([Bike Share Toronto](https://bikesharetoronto.com/) as a popular rental option), using public transportation ([TTC](http://www.ttc.ca/)), and on foot around the event venue.

## Staying in Toronto

The city is an expensive place to live and visit. For those looking at alternative acccomodations including platforms like AirBnB, we wanted to provide context about the housing market. Like many cities around the world, Toronto is experiencing an [affordability crisis](https://www.blogto.com/city/2019/03/report-housing-affordability-crisis-toronto/) in part driven by [condos being treated as investments](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/07/toronto-housing-owner-occupied-canada-affordability) and ["ghost hotels"](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2017/12/01/haunted-by-the-rise-of-ghost-hotels.html). This has recently led to [renovictions](https://nowtoronto.com/news/renovicted-toronto-rental-housing/) and more recently [tenant organizing and rent strikes](http://parkdaleorganize.ca/).

To support folks attending the conference, we have a [community billets](#community-billets) program and provide information on ways to mitigate the impact of short-term rentals. Inspired by [4S 2019 in New Orleans](https://www.4s2019.org/accommodation/), notes on how to make your own guide are shared at the bottom of this page.

### Community billets

Billeting is a way of supporting participants to attend within their budget and at the same time, welcome them into our community. 

We anticipate securing a limited number of spots with people based in Toronto. If you indicated you were interested in hosting or staying in a community billet check out the [community billets list](https://ethercalc.org/s0r2i3dsfznl) and add your info or email [billets@ournetworks.ca](mailto:billets@ournetworks.ca) and we’ll help coordinate!

### Small-businesses and BIPOC-owned hotels

- [Baldwin Village Inn](https://www.urbannorthinns.com/baldwin-village-inn/) and [Urban North Inns](https://www.urbannorthinns.com/), 9 Baldwin Street

We searched and could not confirm a directory of BIPOC-owned accommodations, if you know of any, please contact us. 

### Unionized hotels

We used [Fair Hotels](https://www.fairhotel.org/) and called []
Called [UNITE HERE 75](https://www.uniteherelocal75.org/) for leads and updates, As of May 2019, these hotels are still unionized with them:

- [Chelsea Hotel Toronto](http://www.chelseatoronto.com/en/), 33 Gerrard Street West
- [Kimpton Saint George Hotel](https://www.ihg.com/kimptonhotels/hotels/us/en/saint-george-hotel-toronto-on/yyzbs/hoteldetail), 280 Bloor Street West
- [One King West Hotel & Residence](https://www.onekingwest.com/)

- [Marriott St. Regis](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/yyzxr-the-st-regis-toronto/)

### Other Short-term rentals

Additional care to take if engaging in a short-term rental in Toronto:

1. Avoid hosts with multiple listings.
1. Avoid AirBnB rentals in the following neighbourhoods:
  - Parkdale
1. Avoid these hosts identified by a local nonprofit as AirBnB "ghost hotel" landlords.

Would you like to make a guide like this for your event or city? If so:

- Search for reports from local housing justice organizations. Read them carefully, summarize their insights, and link to them. Use their recommendations to craft your suggestions.
- Categories of hotels to look for include: unionized hotels, small businesses, indigenous-owned hotels, black-owned hotels, as well as latino- and POC-owned hotels. There are U.S lists (see [4S 2019 in New Orleans](https://www.4s2019.org/accommodation/) conference for more), however for Canada we did a lot of searching based on cit
- Feel free to use any of the text above without need for attribution. Please include this note on how others can approach making one for their event or city.
- After you’ve read the reports, distilled their findings, listed unionized hotels and hotels owned by structurally marginalized people, and crafted a first draft of your document then share it with local housing justice for feedback (We're working on this!)
