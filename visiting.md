## Getting Around 

Toronto is easily navigable by bike ([Bike Share Toronto](https://bikesharetoronto.com/) as a popular rental option), using public transportation ([TTC](http://www.ttc.ca/)), and on foot around the event venue.

## Staying in Toronto (a.k.a. What are community billets?)

Toronto is an expensive place to live and visit. For those looking at alternative acccomodations we wanted to provide some context about the Housing Market. Like many cities around the world, we are going through an intense [affordability crisis](https://www.blogto.com/city/2019/03/report-housing-affordability-crisis-toronto/), in part driven by [condos being treated as investments](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/07/toronto-housing-owner-occupied-canada-affordability) and ["ghost hotels"](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2017/12/01/haunted-by-the-rise-of-ghost-hotels.html) that rely on platforms like AirBnB. This has led to a period of [renovictions](https://nowtoronto.com/news/renovicted-toronto-rental-housing/) and more recently, [tenant organizing and rent strikes](http://parkdaleorganize.ca/).


- highlight our community billets
- look at group bookings in homestay? dorms? alternatives? 
- prepare information on union and non-AirBnB options, give context for accom and tourism in Toronto. see 4s accoms for insight: https://www.4s2019.org/accommodation/

Additional care to take if engaging in a short-term rental in New Orleans:

1. Avoid hosts with multiple listings.
1. Avoid AirBnB rentals in neighborhoods ....
1. Avoid these hosts identified by a local nonprofit as AirBnB "ghost hotel" landlords.

Alternatives:

1. Locally-owned

    

1. Unionized-hotels
    
    Used Fair Hotels (looked out of date): https://www.fairhotel.org/
    Called UNITE HERE 75 for leads, some differences. These are still unionized with them as of May 2019:
        One King West Hotel & Residence (too far)
        https://www.onekingwest.com/
        The Omni King Edward Hotel (too far+expensive)
        https://www.guestreservations.com/the-omni-king-edward-hotel/booking
        Marriott St. Regis (too expensive)

Inspired by [](), notes on how to make your own guide copied below:

 

 

Would you like to make a guide like this for your event or city? If so:

    Search for reports from local housing justice organizations. Read them carefully, summarize their insights, and link to them. Use their recommendations to craft your suggestions.
    Find unionized hotels here find black owned hotels here, the Latino Hotel Association and the Asian American Hotel Owners Association sadly don’t not have a directories. Some indigenous-owned hotels are listed here. These lists are incomplete and you will also need to some time googling by city and state.
    Something we didn’t do for this list is have clear accessibility information. Please do better than us!
    Feel free to use any of the text above without need for attribution. Please do include this note on how others can approach making one for their event or city.
    After you’ve read the reports, distilled their findings, listed unionized hotels and hotels owned by structurally marginalized people, and crafted a first draft of your document then share it with local housing justice for feedback.
