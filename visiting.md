We have a slowly-growing list of questions for those visiting Tkaronto (Toronto), if you don't see yours answered below, send us an email at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

### I am traveling from out of town, how can I stay in Toronto affordably? (a.k.a. What are community billets?)

We have arranged a limited number of spots with people based in Toronto for those looking for a place to stay. Billeting is a way of supporting participants to attend within their budget and at the same time, welcome them into our community. If you indicated you were interested in hosting or staying in a community billet we will be contacting you.

### What is the best way to get around Toronto?

Toronto in July is easily navigable by bike ([Bike Share Toronto](https://bikesharetoronto.com/) as a popular rental option), using public transportation ([TTC](http://www.ttc.ca/)), and on foot around the event venues.

### Are the venues accessible?

We are committed to reducing barriers to access throughout the event. All spaces—for Kickoff Yami-ichi, Conference, and Sprints—have elevator access and accessible washrooms.
